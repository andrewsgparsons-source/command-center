      "description": "Transform the Solution Planner from a lightweight dashboard viewer into a comprehensive business management framework. Covers ALL business disciplines — project management, risk, R&D, production, materials, workflow, compliance, grants, environmental, resource management, waste (time + materials). Must be template-able so any business type can be spun up from it. The garden buildings dashboard, Whelpley Farm, Forge AI are all just instances of this universal framework. This IS the Forge AI product — the thing people clone and customise.",
