Market research — what systems exist, what's best-in-class\n2. Andrew's business workflow mapping — enquiry to completion\n3. Gap analysis — what's missing today\n4. System architecture proposal — build/buy/integrate\n5. Feature spec — detailed requirements\n6. Implementation plan — phased delivery roadmap\n7. Prototype / MVP\n\nKey considerations:\n- Configurator is the front door — leads come from 3D config sessions\n- Bespoke business = every job is different (not cookie-cutter)\n- Site visits, custom quoting, build scheduling\n- Small team — system must be lean, not enterprise bloat\n- Automation opportunities: config → lead → quote → schedule",
